title: Interrupts in Sim8085
description: Learn how to simulate hardware interrupts accurately using Sim8085 ‚Äî including TRAP, RST 5.5, RST 6.5, and RST 7.5.
---

Sim8085 now supports realistic hardware interrupt behavior, letting you write and test **interrupt-driven programs** just like on a real Intel 8085 system.

This includes:

- **Line-based triggering** (via UI toggles)
- **Proper masking and enabling**
- **RST 7.5 latch behavior**
- **TRAP as a non-maskable interrupt**
- **SIM / RIM instruction support**

---

## üî¢ Supported Interrupts

| Interrupt | Vector Address | Maskable? | Latching? | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **TRAP**  | `0x24`         | ‚ùå No     | ‚úÖ Yes     | Always enabled |
| **RST 5.5** | `0x2C`       | ‚úÖ Yes    | ‚ùå No      | Level-sensitive |
| **RST 6.5** | `0x34`       | ‚úÖ Yes    | ‚ùå No      | Level-sensitive |
| **RST 7.5** | `0x3C`       | ‚úÖ Yes    | ‚úÖ Yes     | Edge-triggered, latched |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Triggering Interrupts

Use the ‚ö° **Interrupt Panel** from the top bar to toggle interrupt lines:

- **Toggled on = line held HIGH**
- **Toggled off = line LOW**

The CPU will respond to the line **only if**:
- Global interrupts are enabled (`EI` executed)
- The interrupt line is **unmasked** (via `SIM`)

---

## üìä Viewing Interrupt State

The **Interrupts sidebar panel** shows:

- Whether global interrupts are enabled
- Which lines are enabled (i.e. not masked)
- Which interrupts are currently pending

Pending state means the line is HIGH and the interrupt is ready to fire as soon as it's unmasked and enabled.

## üß† Special Behavior: RST 7.5

RST 7.5 is:

- **Edge-triggered** (latched on rising edge)
- **Latched** internally even when disabled or masked
- Must be **cleared manually** via the `SIM` instruction (bit 4)

---

## üì• SIM and RIM Instructions

Sim8085 supports:

- **`SIM`** ‚Äî set interrupt masks, reset RST 7.5 latch, control serial output
- **`RIM`** ‚Äî read interrupt masks, pending status, and serial input

Use these to programmatically enable/disable and inspect interrupt behavior.

---

## ‚úÖ Tips for Writing Interrupt-Driven Programs

- Always use `EI` before you expect interrupts
- Don't forget to `RET` at the end of your ISR
- Use `SIM` to unmask or reset RST 7.5 latch if needed
- You can hold lines high from the UI to simulate real hardware behavior

---

## Example

```asm
EI             ; Enable interrupts
MVI A, 08H     ; MSE = 1, mask bits = 000 ‚Üí unmask all
SIM

HLT            ; Wait for interrupt

MVI A, 01H     ; Resume after handling interrupt
HLT

ORG 002CH      ; RST 5.5 ISR
MVI B, 0AH
RET
````

Now toggle **RST 5.5** from the ‚ö° panel ‚Äî the program will resume and execute the ISR.

## üí° Example: Blink an LED Using RST 5.5

This program will blink an LED connected to **port 1** five times when RST 5.5 is triggered. You can simulate the external interrupt by toggling the RST 5.5 line HIGH in the Interrupt Panel.

To test this progra,
1. Enable `Simulate Instruction Timing` in the Settings panel.
2. Keep the `LED Array` panel open to observe the blinking lights.
3. Toggle RST 5.5 line HIGH in Interrupt Control Panel. Make it LOW to stop the lights from blinking.

```asm
ORG 0000H
MVI A, 00H
EI
LOOP:
    INR A
    MVI B, 0FFH
    MVI C, 0FFH
    CALL DELAY
    JMP LOOP

; === Vector Table ===
ORG 002CH  ; RST 5.5 vector
JMP RST_5_5_ISR

; === ISR Implementation ===
ORG 0100H
RST_5_5_ISR:
    MVI D, 05H
    CALL BLINK_LOOP
    EI
    RET

BLINK_LOOP:
    MVI A, 01H
    OUT 01H
    CALL SHORT_DELAY

    MVI A, 00H
    OUT 01H
    CALL SHORT_DELAY

    DCR D
    JNZ BLINK_LOOP
    RET

SHORT_DELAY:
    MVI B, 10H
    MVI C, 00H
    CALL DELAY
    RET

DELAY:
    DCX B
    MOV A, B
    ORA C
    JNZ DELAY
    RET
```

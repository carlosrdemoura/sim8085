Sim8085 is a powerful graphical simulator, assembler, and debugger specifically
designed for the Intel 8085 microprocessor. It serves as an educational tool for
students, hobbyists, and developers who want to learn and experiment with
assembly language programming. By providing an intuitive interface and a variety
of features, Sim8085 simplifies the process of writing, debugging, and executing
assembly programs.

## Key Features

- **Graphical User Interface**: Sim8085 offers a user-friendly graphical interface
that makes it easy to navigate through different components and functionalities.
This interface is particularly helpful for beginners who are just getting
started with microprocessor programming.

- **Syntax Highlighting Editor**: The built-in editor supports syntax
highlighting for assembly language, allowing users to write code more
efficiently while reducing the likelihood of errors.

- **Memory and I/O Visualization**: Users can view registers, flags, memory, and I/O
ports, which helps in understanding how the 8085 microprocessor manages data and
executes instructions.

- **Debugging Support**: With features like breakpoints and stepwise program
execution, Sim8085 provides essential tools for debugging assembly code. This
allows users to run their programs incrementally and inspect the state of the
system at each step.

- **Opcode Conversion**: Users can convert their assembly
programs into opcode listings with just one click, simplifying the process of
preparing programs for execution on the actual hardware.

title: Unsupported Features
description: Sim8085 does not support some instructions and advanced assmebler features yet.
---

We have tried our best to implement as many features specified in the original
8080/85 Assembly Language Programming Manual but due to time constraints and
not been able to implement all of them. We want the application to be useful
to users as soon as possible and thus we have released the application with
these missing features.

We will be implementing all of these in due time.

If you believe any of these are essential, please raise a request through the
GitHub issues page.

### Unsupported Instructions

The application does not _yet_ implement the interrupt system and the related
instructions such as `RST`, `EI`, `DI` etc.

### Unsupported Directives

The application does not support the following,

- `DS`
- `IF`, `ELSE` & `ENDIF`
- `END`
- `EOT`
- Some of the relocation directives, `CSEG`, `DSEG`, `PUBLIC`, `EXTRN`, `NAME`, `STKLN` & the `STACK` and `MEMORY`
reserved words.
- None of the macro directives, `MACRO`, `ENDM`, `LOCAL`, `REPT`, `IRP`, `IRPC`, `EXITM`

### Unsupported Expressions

Apart of the arithmetic expression, no other kind of expression are supported right now.

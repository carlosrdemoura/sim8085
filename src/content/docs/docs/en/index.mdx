title: What is Sim8085?
description: Sim8085 is a fast, accurate, and offline-capable 8085 microprocessor simulator with full mobile and desktop support â€” ideal for students, educators, and developers.
---

**Sim8085** is a modern, graphical simulator, assembler, and debugger for the **Intel 8085 microprocessor**, designed for students, educators, and enthusiasts. It combines a clean user interface with deep technical accuracy, making it the most intuitive and reliable way to write, run, and debug 8085 assembly programs.

Unlike traditional desktop tools, Sim8085 runs **directly in your browser** â€” yet works **fully offline**, even in **airplane mode**, after the first visit.

## ðŸ”§ Why Sim8085?

- âœ… **Accurate Instruction Simulation**  
  Every instruction, flag, and timing behavior is modeled with care â€” matching real-world 8085 behavior more closely than legacy tools.

- âœ… **Near-Native Performance**  
  The simulation engine is written in C and compiled with Emscripten, offering performance close to native desktop apps â€” all within your browser.

- âœ… **100% Offline Support**  
  No internet required after your first visit. Sim8085 runs entirely offline â€” perfect for exams, travel, or classrooms without Wi-Fi.

- âœ… **Modern UI, No Installation**  
  Say goodbye to clunky desktop GUIs. Sim8085 offers a smooth, responsive interface in your browser with no setup needed.

- âœ… **Install as an App**  
  Use Sim8085 directly in your mobile browser, or install it to your home screen for an app-like experience â€” no app store needed.

- âœ… **Mobile-Optimized Interface**  
  Use Sim8085 on your phone or tablet. It adapts to smaller screens with a responsive layout built for touch.

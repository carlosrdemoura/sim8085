title: 8085 Program for an Automatic Lawn Irrigation System
description: Simulate a smart irrigation controller using 8085 assembly and I/O ports based on soil moisture, rain sensor, time of day, and manual override.
---

Design an **8085 assembly program** that simulates a basic automatic lawn irrigation system. The program should:

* **Turn ON** irrigation only when:

  * Manual override is not active
  * Soil is dry
  * It's not raining
  * It's not daytime

If **manual override is ON**, irrigation must always turn on, regardless of other conditions.

---

### ðŸ”Œ Interface (Ports)

| Port (Hex) | Purpose              | Input Value Meaning             |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `00H`      | Soil Moisture Sensor | `1 = Moist`, `0 = Dry`          |
| `01H`      | Rain Sensor          | `1 = Raining`, `0 = Dry`        |
| `02H`      | Time of Day          | `1 = Daytime`, `0 = Night`      |
| `03H`      | Manual Override      | `1 = Force ON`, `0 = Auto Mode` |
| `10H`      | Output to Valve      | `1 = Irrigation ON`, `0 = OFF`  |

---

## âš¡ TL;DR â€” Final Working Code

```asm
        ; Step 1: Check Manual Override
        IN 03H
        CPI 01H
        JZ MANUAL_ON

        ; Step 2: Check Soil Moisture
        IN 00H
        CPI 01H
        JZ IRRIGATION_OFF

        ; Step 3: Check Rain Sensor
        IN 01H
        CPI 01H
        JZ IRRIGATION_OFF

        ; Step 4: Check Time of Day
        IN 02H
        CPI 01H
        JZ IRRIGATION_OFF

        ; All conditions passed â†’ Irrigation ON
        MVI A, 01H
        OUT 10H
        HLT

MANUAL_ON:
        MVI A, 01H
        OUT 10H
        HLT

IRRIGATION_OFF:
        MVI A, 00H
        OUT 10H
        HLT
```

---

## ðŸ§± Step 1: Control the Irrigation Valve with a Simple Output

Before building decision logic, we first need to **define how to turn irrigation ON or OFF** from the 8085.

This step introduces the **output port** connected to the irrigation valve.

---

### ðŸ“¦ Output Interface

| Port  | Purpose                  | Accepted Values     |
| ----- | ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| `10H` | Irrigation Control Valve | `0 = OFF`, `1 = ON` |

Weâ€™ll directly send a value to this port to simulate the valve being turned **ON or OFF**.

---

### ðŸ§  Why Start Here?

* It gives us a **simple, verifiable action** to test
* It introduces the concept of **output control** using the `OUT` instruction
* It lays the groundwork for plugging in more complex logic later

---

### ðŸ§¾ Code (Manual Valve Control)

```asm
MVI A, 01H       ; Load A with 1 to simulate "turn ON"
OUT 10H          ; Send A to port 10H
HLT              ; Stop execution
```

---

### ðŸ§ª Manual Test

Try changing `MVI A, 01H` to `MVI A, 00H` to simulate turning **OFF** the irrigation.

Expected:

* Port `10H` reflects the ON/OFF signal
* Easy to test using I/O monitor in Sim8085

---

## ðŸ§± Step 2: Add Manual Override as Input

Now that we can control the valve through an output port, letâ€™s add **manual override** as an input condition.

When the override switch is **ON** (`1`), irrigation should **always turn ON** regardless of other sensor inputs.

---

### ðŸ“¦ I/O Interface Update

| Port  | Purpose             | Value `0`      | Value `1`           |
| ----- | ------------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| `03H` | Manual Override     | Automatic mode | Force irrigation ON |
| `10H` | Valve Control (OUT) | OFF            | ON                  |

---

### ðŸ§  How This Works

* We **read the override input** from port `03H` using `IN`
* If the value is `01H`, we **skip all sensor checks** and go straight to turning irrigation ON

This models **user-first logic**: a manual switch overrides all automation.

---

### ðŸ§¾ Code Snippet (Manual Override)

```asm
IN 03H          ; Read from port 03H (Manual Override)
CPI 01H         ; Compare with 1 (Override ON)
JZ MANUAL_ON    ; If equal, jump to force ON

HLT             ; Temporary end

MANUAL_ON:
MVI A, 01H      ; Force irrigation ON
OUT 10H         ; Send ON signal to valve
HLT
```

---

### ðŸ§ª Manual Test

Try:

```
03H = 00H  â†’ Should not jump (automation continues)
03H = 01H  â†’ Should jump to MANUAL_ON and turn irrigation ON
```

---

## ðŸ§± Step 3: Check Soil Moisture Sensor

If the **manual override is OFF**, we now begin evaluating environmental conditions â€” starting with the **soil moisture sensor**.

If the soil is already **moist**, irrigation is **not needed**.

---

### ðŸ“¦ I/O Update

| Port  | Purpose             | Value `0`         | Value `1`             |
| ----- | ------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| `00H` | Soil Moisture Input | Dry (needs water) | Moist (skip watering) |

---

### ðŸ§  What Weâ€™re Doing

* Read input from port `00H` (soil moisture)
* If itâ€™s moist (`01H`), jump to `IRRIGATION_OFF`
* If dry (`00H`), continue to the next condition (rain sensor)

---

### ðŸ§¾ Code Snippet (Soil Moisture Check)

```asm
IN 00H          ; Read soil moisture from port 00H
CPI 01H         ; Is soil moist?
JZ IRRIGATION_OFF   ; Yes â†’ skip irrigation
```

---

### ðŸ§ª Manual Test

Try setting:

```
00H = 01H  â†’ moist â†’ jumps to IRRIGATION_OFF
00H = 00H  â†’ dry   â†’ continues to next condition
```

---

## ðŸ§± Step 4: Check the Rain Sensor

If the soil is dry and manual override is **not active**, the next check is the **rain sensor**.

If it's currently **raining**, irrigation should be **turned OFF** â€” watering during rain is wasteful.

---

### ðŸ“¦ I/O Summary (Rain Sensor)

| Port  | Purpose     | Value `0`          | Value `1`               |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `01H` | Rain Sensor | No rain (continue) | Raining (skip watering) |

---

### ðŸ§  What Weâ€™re Doing

* Read input from port `01H`
* If rain is detected (`01H`), **jump to `IRRIGATION_OFF`**
* If not raining (`00H`), proceed to the final check â€” time of day

This prevents unnecessary watering during active rainfall.

---

### ðŸ§¾ Code Snippet (Rain Check)

```asm
IN 01H          ; Read rain sensor input from port 01H
CPI 01H         ; Is it raining?
JZ IRRIGATION_OFF   ; Yes â†’ turn irrigation OFF
```

---

### ðŸ§ª Manual Test

Try setting:

```
01H = 01H â†’ raining â†’ jump to IRRIGATION_OFF  
01H = 00H â†’ dry â†’ continue to time-of-day check
```

---

## ðŸ§± Step 5: Check Time of Day Before Irrigation

If the soil is dry, it's not raining, and manual override is off â€” the last condition to check is the **time of day**.

We assume that irrigation should **only happen at night** (for example, to reduce evaporation).

---

### ðŸ“¦ I/O Summary (Time Sensor)

| Port  | Purpose     | Value `0`        | Value `1`      |
| ----- | ----------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| `02H` | Time of Day | Night (continue) | Daytime (skip) |

---

### ðŸ§  What Weâ€™re Doing

* Read port `02H` to get time info
* If it's **daytime (`01H`)**, skip irrigation
* If it's **night (`00H`)**, proceed to turn it ON

This simulates **energy-efficient watering schedules**.

---

### ðŸ§¾ Code Snippet (Time Check)

```asm
IN 02H            ; Read time-of-day input
CPI 01H           ; Is it daytime?
JZ IRRIGATION_OFF ; Yes â†’ skip irrigation
```

If we pass all conditions:

```asm
; All checks passed â†’ turn irrigation ON
MVI A, 01H
OUT 10H
HLT
```

---

### ðŸ§ª Final Manual Test Cases

Try these combinations of input:

| OVR | SM | RAIN | TIME | Expected Output  |
| --- | -- | ---- | ---- | ---------------- |
| 1   | X  | X    | X    | ON (override)    |
| 0   | 1  | X    | X    | OFF (moist soil) |
| 0   | 0  | 1    | X    | OFF (raining)    |
| 0   | 0  | 0    | 1    | OFF (daytime)    |
| 0   | 0  | 0    | 0    | ON (all clear)   |

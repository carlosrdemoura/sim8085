description: An 8085 assembly program that adds two 8-bit numbers stored in memory and stores the result at a defined memory location.
---

import AdBlock from "../../../../../components/AdBlock.astro";

Write an 8085 assembly program to add two 8-bit numbers stored in memory. The result should be stored in a specified memory location.

* Input:

  * `2500H` = first number  
  * `2501H` = second number
* Output:

  * `3000H` = result of the addition

## ⚡ TL;DR — Final Working Code

```asm
        ; Define interface addresses
        FIRST_INPUT   EQU 2500H
        SECOND_INPUT  EQU 2501H
        RESULT_LOW    EQU 2502H
        RESULT_HIGH   EQU 2503H

        ; Step 1: Load inputs
        LXI H, FIRST_INPUT
        MOV A, M             ; A ← first number
        INX H
        MOV B, M             ; B ← second number

        ; Step 2: Perform addition
        ADD B                ; A ← A + B
        MOV C, 00H           ; Assume no carry
        JNC SKIP_CARRY
        INR C                ; If carry, C ← 01H
SKIP_CARRY:

        ; Step 3: Store result
        LXI H, RESULT_LOW
        MOV M, A             ; Store sum
        INX H
        MOV M, C             ; Store carry
        HLT
```

## 🧱 Step 1: Define the Interface

Before writing the logic, we need to define how this program will communicate with the external world — this is called the **interface**.

---

### 📦 Interface Definition

We’ll keep all inputs and outputs in the same memory page for clarity and ease of testing.

| Address | Role                         |
|---------|------------------------------|
| `2500H` | First 8-bit input            |
| `2501H` | Second 8-bit input           |
| `2502H` | Output: sum (lower byte)     |
| `2503H` | Output: carry (00H or 01H)   |

This interface supports both:
- ✅ Simple use case (just 8-bit sum)
- ✅ Advanced case (with carry handling, if added later)

---

### 🧠 Why Interface Design Matters

An interface defines the contract between your program and everything outside it. Good interface design means:

- Inputs and outputs are clearly separated
- The module can be extended without breaking
- The user knows exactly where to place test values

---

### ❌ Bad Interface Examples

- Leaving the result in a register only
- Overwriting one of the input addresses
- Storing the result across non-contiguous memory

---

### 🧾 Code (Input Preparation Only)

Let’s just load the two input numbers from memory to understand the data flow.

```asm
LXI H, 2500H     ; HL → first input
MOV A, M         ; A ← first number
INX H            ; HL → second input
MOV B, M         ; B ← second number
HLT
````

---

### 🧪 Manual Test

Set memory:

```
2500H = 0AH
2501H = 14H
```

Expected after halt:

* Register A = 0AH
* Register B = 14H

You’ve now read both inputs into registers. Next, we’ll perform the actual addition.

---

## 🧱 Step 2: Perform the Addition

Now that we've loaded the two input numbers into registers, the next step is to **perform the addition** and **preserve the result**, including the carry if any.

---

### 🧠 What Happens in This Step

We'll:

* Add the value in register `B` to the value in `A` using `ADD B`
* Check the carry flag (`CY`) to see if the result overflowed 8 bits
* Store the lower byte of the result in `A`
* Prepare a value (`00H` or `01H`) based on whether carry occurred

---

### 🧾 Code (Addition Logic Only)

```asm
ADD B             ; A ← A + B
MOV C, 00H        ; Assume no carry
JNC SKIP_CARRY    ; If no carry, skip
INR C             ; If carry occurred, C ← 01H

SKIP_CARRY:
HLT
```

* After `ADD B`, the sum is in `A`.
* If the addition caused a carry, we increment `C`.
* Now `C` holds the **carry byte** (`00H` or `01H`) to store alongside the result.

---

### 🧪 Manual Test

Set:

```
2500H = 0AH   ; A = 10
2501H = 14H   ; B = 20
```

Expected:

* A = `1EH` (30 in decimal)
* C = `00H` (no carry)

Try with:

```
2500H = FFH
2501H = 01H
```

Expected:

* A = `00H` (overflow)
* C = `01H` (carry)


This step sets up both parts of the result: the 8-bit sum and the carry. Next, we’ll store them into memory.

## 🧱 Step 3: Store the Result in Memory

We now have the result of the addition:

* The **sum** (lower 8 bits) is in register `A`
* The **carry** (if any) is in register `C`

Our task is to store these two values at the predefined output addresses so the result is preserved even after the program halts.

---

### 📦 Output Mapping (Reminder)

| Address | Purpose            |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| `2502H` | Sum (lower byte)   |
| `2503H` | Carry (00H or 01H) |

We’ll use the HL pair to point to `2502H` and write the results in order.

---

### 🧾 Code to Store Result

```asm
LXI H, 2502H     ; HL → first output address
MOV M, A         ; Store sum at 2502H
INX H            ; HL → next address
MOV M, C         ; Store carry at 2503H
HLT
```

This makes your output traceable and testable even after execution ends.

---

### 🧪 Manual Test

Try:

```
2500H = FFH
2501H = 01H
```

Expected memory after execution:

```
2502H = 00H   ; Sum = 00H (overflow)
2503H = 01H   ; Carry = 01H
```

Try another:

```
2500H = 0AH
2501H = 05H
```

Expected:

```
2502H = 0FH   ; Sum = 15
2503H = 00H   ; No carry
```

You’ve now completed the full data flow: load → compute → store.

## 📚 Summary

This program demonstrates how to add two 8-bit numbers in 8085 assembly while handling potential overflow:

* **Inputs** are placed in contiguous memory (`2500H`, `2501H`)
* The **sum** is calculated and stored in `A`
* A **carry check** is performed using `JNC` and stored in a separate byte
* Final results are written to memory for inspection

---

### 🔍 Key Learnings

* Use `ADD` to combine register values and update flags
* Use `JNC` to detect overflow via the carry flag
* Always design your memory interface clearly when sharing results with the outside world

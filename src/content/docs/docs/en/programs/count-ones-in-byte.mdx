title: 8085 Program to Count Number of 1’s in an 8-bit Number
description: An 8085 assembly program that counts the number of bits set to 1 in a given byte using bitwise rotation and carry flag logic.
---

Write an 8085 assembly program that counts how many bits are set to 1 in a given 8-bit number stored in memory.

* Input:

  * `2500H` = one 8-bit number
* Output:

  * `3000H` = number of bits set (0 to 8)

---

## ⚡ TL;DR — Final Working Code

```asm
        INPUT_ADDR  EQU 2500H       ; Input byte
        OUTPUT_ADDR EQU 3000H       ; Output: bit count

        LXI H, INPUT_ADDR
        MOV A, M                    ; A ← input byte
        MVI C, 00H                  ; C ← bit count
        MVI B, 08H                  ; B ← number of bits to check

LOOP:   RAR                         ; Rotate bit 0 into carry
        JNC SKIP
        INR C                       ; If carry = 1, increment count

SKIP:   DCR B
        JNZ LOOP

        LXI H, OUTPUT_ADDR
        MOV M, C                    ; Store count
        HLT
```

## 🧱 Step 1: Define the Interface

Just like with other problems, we start by asking:

> **How will this module receive input and return output?**

This problem is focused on **bitwise analysis**, so we need a simple interface where we can isolate and test a single byte.

---

### 📦 Interface Definition

| Address | Meaning                    |
| ------- | -------------------------- |
| `2500H` | The 8-bit number (input)   |
| `3000H` | Output: count of 1’s (0–8) |

This interface is:

* Simple and focused
* Easy to test in a simulator
* Extendable (you could later apply it to an entire array)

---

### 🧠 Why This Is a Good Interface

* One input, one output → clean and traceable
* Does not rely on flags or registers after execution
* Keeps logic focused on a single byte (makes the loop tight)

---

### ❌ Bad Interface Examples

* Writing the count back to the input address (overwrites test case)
* Leaving the result only in a register (lost after program halts)
* Storing multiple things without clear layout

---

### 🧾 Code (Load the Byte Only)

Let’s begin by just loading the input value into a register.

```asm
LXI H, 2500H     ; HL → input byte
MOV A, M         ; A ← value to count bits from
HLT              ; Pause to verify A
```

---

### 🧪 Manual Test

Set memory:

```
2500H = 5AH   ; Binary: 01011010 → 4 bits set
```

Expected:

* Register `A` = `5AH` after execution

This prepares the input for bitwise processing in the next step.

---

## 🧱 Step 2: Count the Number of 1’s Bit-by-Bit

We’ve loaded the byte into register `A`. Now we’ll check each of its bits and **count how many are set (1)**.

---

### 💡 What We're Doing

* Use **rotate instructions** to shift bits and expose each one
* Use the **carry flag** as an indicator (after rotation)
* Use a register (say, `C`) to **count the number of 1’s**

---

### 🧠 How This Works

* `RAR` (Rotate Accumulator Right through Carry) moves bit 0 into the carry flag
* We check the carry using `JNC` (if carry not set)
* If carry is set → increment counter

We’ll do this **8 times**, once for each bit.

---

### 🧾 Code to Count 1’s

```asm
LXI H, 2500H     ; HL → input value
MOV A, M         ; A ← input byte
MVI C, 00H       ; C ← count of 1s
MVI B, 08H       ; B ← number of bits to check

LOOP: RAR                 ; Rotate right, bit 0 → CY
      JNC SKIP            ; If carry not set, skip increment
      INR C               ; Else, increment count

SKIP: DCR B               ; Decrement bit counter
      JNZ LOOP            ; Repeat if bits remain

HLT
```

---

### 🧪 Manual Test

Set:

```
2500H = 5AH   ; Binary = 01011010 → 4 bits set
```

Expected:

* Register `C` = `04H`

Try:

```
2500H = FFH → All 8 bits set → C = 08H
2500H = 00H → All 0 → C = 00H
```

---

### 🧠 Why RAR Instead of ANI?

We use `RAR` because:

* It shifts bits into the **carry flag**, which we can check easily
* It avoids needing a mask (`ANI`) and avoids messing with accumulator contents

---

## 🧱 Step 3: Store the Result in Memory

After counting all the 1’s:

* The final result is in register `C`
* We want to **store it in memory** at a predefined output location

This step completes the module’s contract:

> Read from input → compute → write output

---

### 📦 Output Location

We’ll use:

```
3000H = final count of 1’s (0–8)
```

This makes the result persistent and inspectable after program halts.

---

### 🧾 Full Code with Storage

```asm
        ; Interface
        INPUT_ADDR  EQU 2500H
        OUTPUT_ADDR EQU 3000H

        ; Step 1: Load input
        LXI H, INPUT_ADDR
        MOV A, M             ; A ← byte to count 1s from

        ; Step 2: Initialize counters
        MVI C, 00H           ; C ← bit count
        MVI B, 08H           ; B ← number of bits

LOOP:   RAR                  ; Rotate bit 0 → Carry
        JNC SKIP             ; If carry = 0, skip
        INR C                ; Else, increment count

SKIP:   DCR B
        JNZ LOOP

        ; Step 3: Store result
        LXI H, OUTPUT_ADDR
        MOV M, C
        HLT
```

---

### 🧪 Manual Test

Set:

```
2500H = 0FH   ; Binary = 00001111
```

Expected:

```
3000H = 04H   ; 4 bits set
```

Try a few more:

* `FFH` → result = 08H
* `00H` → result = 00H
* `AAH` → result = 04H

---

## 🧱 Step 4: Refactor and Clean Up

Our current program is correct and relatively clean, but with a few small improvements, we can make it:

* Easier to understand
* Slightly more efficient
* Easier to reuse

---

### 🔧 Improvements

#### ✅ 1. Use Clear Constants

We already use `INPUT_ADDR` and `OUTPUT_ADDR`, which is good. Ensure these are at the top.

#### ✅ 2. Avoid Switching HL Unnecessarily

We used HL twice: once for reading, once for writing. We can keep it focused on **one task** — either input or output — and let `A` carry the data.

#### ✅ 3. Add Semantic Comments

Make it obvious why we rotate, why we count, and what each register means.

---

### 🧾 Refactored Code

```asm
        ; Interface definitions
        INPUT_ADDR  EQU 2500H       ; Byte to check
        OUTPUT_ADDR EQU 3000H       ; Store count of 1s

        ; Step 1: Load input byte
        LXI H, INPUT_ADDR
        MOV A, M                    ; A ← input value
        MVI C, 00H                  ; C ← count of 1s
        MVI B, 08H                  ; B ← bit counter

        ; Step 2: Loop through bits
LOOP:   RAR                         ; Rotate right, LSB → CY
        JNC SKIP                    ; If CY = 0, skip
        INR C                       ; Else, increment count

SKIP:   DCR B                       ; B ← B - 1
        JNZ LOOP

        ; Step 3: Store result
        LXI H, OUTPUT_ADDR
        MOV M, C
        HLT
```

---

### ✨ Result

* **Registers are used meaningfully**: A for rotating, B for bit loop, C for counting
* **No register reuse confusion** — each one has one job
* **Interface addresses are named** and easy to change

---

## 📚 Summary

This problem takes us into **bitwise thinking**. It teaches:

* How to **inspect individual bits** using rotation and carry
* How to design a tight **bit-counting loop**
* The use of **semantic registers** (`A` for rotation, `C` for counting, `B` for loop)
* How to **separate computation from interface** using meaningful memory addresses

Together, it builds a foundation for more advanced tasks like:

* Parity checking
* Bitmasking
* Microcontroller-level bit manipulation

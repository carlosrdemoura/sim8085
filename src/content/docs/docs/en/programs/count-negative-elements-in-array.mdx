title: Count Number of Negative Elements in an Array
description: Learn how to count the number of negative (MSB = 1) elements in a block of data using 8085 assembly and the CMP instruction.
---

import AdBlock from "../../../../../components/AdBlock.astro";

Write an 8085 program to determine how many elements in a given array are **negative**. In 8085, negative 8-bit numbers are represented using **two's complement**, so any number with the **most significant bit (MSB)** set to 1 is considered negative.

- The length of the array is stored at memory location `41H`.
- The array starts at memory location `42H`.
- The result (number of negative elements) should be stored at memory location `40H`.

ðŸ§ª Sample Input:
```
(41H) = 05   ; length
(42H) = 15H  ; +ve
(43H) = 9CH  ; -ve
(44H) = 7EH  ; +ve
(45H) = E1H  ; -ve
(46H) = 2AH  ; +ve

```

âœ… Expected Output:
```
(40H) = 02H  ; 9CH and E1H are negative
```

### âœ… TL;DR â€” Final Working Code

```asm
LXI H, 41H     ; HL points to length (41H)
MOV B, M       ; Load length into B
MVI C, 00H     ; Initialize negative count to 0
MVI A, 7FH     ; Highest positive value (0111 1111B)

NEXT: INX H     ; Move to next data byte
CMP M          ; Compare with 7FH
JNC SKIP       ; If not negative, skip
INR C          ; Increment count if MSB = 1

SKIP: DCR B     ; Decrement counter
JNZ NEXT       ; Loop until B = 0

MOV A, C       ; Move count to accumulator
STA 40H        ; Store result at memory 40H
HLT            ; End program
```

### âœ… Step 1: Load Array Length and Initialize Count

Start by setting up the registers:

- Use `LXI H, 41H` to point to the memory where the array length is stored.
- Move the length into a loop counter register, say `B`.
- Set a counter register (like `C`) to 0 to track the number of negative values.
- Also load `7FH` (0111 1111B) into `A`. This value is the **largest positive 8-bit number**, and will be used with `CMP` to check if each element is negative.

> ðŸ§  Why 7FH? Because any value greater than 7F (i.e., with MSB = 1) is considered negative in twoâ€™s complement. `CMP` helps us check that by setting the carry flag.

Now you're ready to process each element in the next step.

### âœ… Step 2: Loop Through Each Element

With your counter (`B`) holding the number of elements and `HL` pointing to `41H`, we now want to:

1. Increment `HL` to point to the next data element.
2. Use `CMP M` to compare it with `7FH` (stored in `A`).
3. If the result sets the **carry flag (CY = 1)**, we increment our count of negative numbers.
4. Decrement `B` and repeat until `B = 0`.

> ðŸ§  *We donâ€™t load the memory value into `A` directly, because that would overwrite our 7FH reference. `CMP M` is ideal hereâ€”it checks the value and sets flags without changing any registers.*

---

#### ðŸ§ª Modified Code (continued from Step 1)

```asm
LXI H, 41H     ; HL points to 41H (length)
MOV B, M       ; Load count into B
MVI C, 00H     ; Counter for negative numbers = 0
MVI A, 7FH     ; 0111 1111B - highest positive number

NEXT: INX H     ; Move to next data byte (starts at 42H)
CMP M          ; Compare current value with 7FH
JNC SKIP       ; If no carry, it's non-negative â†’ skip
INR C          ; If carry, increment negative count

SKIP: DCR B     ; Decrement loop counter
JNZ NEXT       ; Repeat if more elements remain
```

---

In the next step, we'll store the final count in memory and wrap up the program.

---

### âœ… Step 3: Store the Result and End the Program

After the loop finishes, the register `C` contains the number of negative elements.

Now, all that's left is:

1. Move the result from `C` to the accumulator `A`.
2. Store `A` into memory location `40H`, which is reserved for the final output.

> ðŸ’¡ Itâ€™s good practice to move the result to `A` before storing, because `STA addr` always stores the value of the accumulator.

---

#### ðŸ§ª Modified Code (Final Part)

```asm
MOV A, C       ; Move result to accumulator
STA 40H        ; Store result at 40H
HLT            ; End of program
```

With this, the full loop is complete and the result is saved. You can now test this in Sim8085 by placing a value at `41H`, filling the array starting at `42H`, and checking `40H` after execution.

### ðŸ“Œ Summary

* This program counts **how many bytes have MSB = 1**, i.e., are negative in 2â€™s complement form.
* We use `CMP` with `7FH` to determine whether a number is negative. If the memory value is **greater than 7FH**, the **carry flag is set**, indicating a negative number.
* The **carry flag** is checked using `JNC` to skip non-negative values.
* Count is tracked in register `C` and stored in `40H` after the loop.
* The program is efficient and does **not modify** the array itself.

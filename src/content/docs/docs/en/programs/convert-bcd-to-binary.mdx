title: 8085 Program to Convert a Two‑Digit BCD to Binary
description: An 8085 assembly program that converts a two-digit packed BCD (stored in one byte) into its binary equivalent using mask, rotate, and repeated addition logic.
---

import AdBlock from "../../../../../components/AdBlock.astro";

Write an 8085 assembly program that reads a **packed two-digit BCD** value from memory (e.g., `XY` in one byte, where `X` and `Y` are decimal digits), converts it to its **binary equivalent**, and stores the result in memory as a single 8-bit number.

* **Input**:

  * `2500H` = one packed BCD byte (e.g., `0x67` → decimal 67)
  
* **Output**:

  * `3000H` = corresponding binary value (e.g., `0x43` → decimal 67)

## ⚡ TL;DR — Final Working Code

```asm
; Interface
INPUT_ADDR  EQU     2500H
OUTPUT_ADDR EQU     3000H

; Step 1: Load the BCD byte
          LXI     H, INPUT_ADDR
          MOV     A, M                ; A ← packed BCD byte
          MOV     B, A                ; Save a copy

; Step 2: Extract units digit
          ANI     0FH                 ; Mask lower nibble
          MOV     C, A                ; C ← units digit

; Step 2: Extract tens digit
          MOV     A, B                ; Restore original byte
          ANI     0F0H                ; Mask upper nibble
          RRC                         ; Right shift ×4 to get tens digit
          RRC
          RRC
          RRC
          MOV     B, A                ; B ← tens digit

; Step 3: Multiply tens × 10 and add units
          MVI     A, 00H              ; Clear A to accumulate result
          MVI     D, 0AH              ; D ← 10
MUL_LOOP: ADD     B
          DCR     D
          JNZ     MUL_LOOP
          ADD     C                   ; Add units
          MOV     D, A                ; Final result → D

; Step 4: Store binary result
          LXI     H, OUTPUT_ADDR
          MOV     M, D
          HLT
```

## 🧱 Step 1: Define the Interface and Load the Input

In this problem, we’re converting a **packed BCD value** (two decimal digits in one byte) into its **binary equivalent**. That means we need to extract the high and low nibbles and compute:

> **Binary = (tens digit × 10) + units digit**

---

### 📦 Interface Definition

| Address | Purpose                            |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `2500H` | Input: Packed BCD byte (e.g., 67H) |
| `3000H` | Output: 8-bit binary result        |

This keeps the problem clean and easy to simulate. The input is static, the output is stored clearly, and no flags or temporary memory are needed.

---

### 🧾 Code (Just Load Input)

Let’s begin by reading the BCD byte from memory:

```asm
LXI H, 2500H     ; HL → input address
MOV A, M         ; A ← packed BCD (e.g., 67H)
HLT              ; Pause to inspect A
```

---

### 🧪 Manual Test

If memory is set to:

```
2500H = 67H   ; BCD for decimal 67
```

After execution:

* Register `A` should contain `67H`
* This confirms the program has loaded the input correctly and is ready to unpack the digits in the next step

## 🧱 Step 2: Unpack the BCD Nibbles

A packed BCD byte stores two decimal digits:

* High nibble (upper 4 bits) = tens place
* Low nibble (lower 4 bits) = units place

We need to extract these digits so we can compute the decimal value:

> **Binary = (tens × 10) + units**

---

### 🧠 What We're Doing

* Load the packed BCD byte into the accumulator
* Copy the accumulator to another register (we’ll need both parts)
* Use bitwise AND masking (`ANI`) to:

  * Extract **lower nibble** (`ANI 0FH`) → units
  * Extract **upper nibble** (`ANI F0H` followed by `RRC RRC RRC RRC`) → tens

---

### 🧾 Code (Unpack Phase Only)

```asm
LXI H, 2500H     ; HL → input byte
MOV A, M         ; A ← packed BCD (e.g., 67H)
MOV B, A         ; Preserve copy for later use
ANI 0FH          ; A ← lower nibble (units)
MOV C, A         ; C ← units digit

MOV A, B         ; Restore original byte
ANI F0H          ; A ← upper nibble (tens × 16)
RRC              ; Shift right ×4 to get actual tens
RRC
RRC
RRC
MOV B, A         ; B ← tens digit
HLT
```

---

### 🧪 Manual Test

For `2500H = 67H`:

* `B` = 6 (tens)
* `C` = 7 (units)

Now we’re ready to compute `B × 10 + C` in the next step.

---

## 🧱 Step 3: Multiply the Tens Digit by 10 and Add Units

Now that we’ve extracted the **tens digit** (in register `B`) and **units digit** (in register `C`), it’s time to compute the final binary value:

> **Binary = (B × 10) + C**

We'll do this using **repeated addition**, since 8085 doesn’t support multiplication directly.

---

### 🧠 What We're Doing

* Use a loop to add the tens digit (`B`) to itself 10 times
* Accumulate the result in a register (`D`)
* Add the units digit (`C`) to the result

This gives us the full binary equivalent of the original BCD value.

---

### 🧾 Code (Multiplication and Addition)

```asm
MVI D, 00H       ; D ← result (starts at 0)
MVI E, 0AH       ; E ← 10 (multiplier)

MUL_LOOP:
ADD B            ; A ← A + B (each time adds 1 × tens)
DCR E
JNZ MUL_LOOP     ; Repeat until E = 0

ADD C            ; Add units digit
MOV D, A         ; Final result → D
HLT
```

---

### 🧪 Manual Test

If:

* `B` = 6 (tens digit)
* `C` = 7 (units digit)

Then:

* After loop: `A` = 60
* After adding `C`: `A` = 67

This completes the computation. In the next step, we’ll store the binary result in memory.

---

## 🧱 Step 4: Store the Result in Memory

Once the final binary value is computed, we need to write it to a well-defined memory location so the result is visible and usable.

---

### 📦 Output Location

| Address | Meaning             |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| `3000H` | Final binary result |

This location acts as the program’s **output interface**, decoupling logic from display or downstream use.

---

### 🧠 What We're Doing

* Store the contents of register `A` (which holds the final result) to memory
* Use a labeled address like `OUTPUT_ADDR` for clarity

---

### 🧾 Code (Store Result)

```asm
LXI H, 3000H     ; HL → output location
MOV M, A         ; Store binary result at 3000H
HLT
```

---

### 🧪 Manual Test

If `2500H = 67H` (BCD for decimal 67), after execution:

```
3000H = 43H   ; Binary 67
```

## 📚 Summary

This program converts a packed 2-digit **BCD** value (e.g., `67H`) into its pure **binary** form (`43H`, which is decimal 67). It teaches:

* How to **extract nibbles** from a byte using `ANI`
* How to **shift and interpret BCD digits**
* Performing multiplication using **repeated addition**
* Proper **interface separation** with clearly assigned memory roles

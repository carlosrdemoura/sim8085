description: Learn how to find the largest value in a list of numbers using 8085 assembly. Step-by-step explanation with register usage and in-memory operations.
---

import AdBlock from "../../../../../components/AdBlock.astro";

Write an 8085 assembly program that scans an array stored in memory, finds the largest number, and stores the result at a predefined memory location.

* Input interface:

  * `2500H` = number of elements (N)
  * `2501H` to `2500H + N` = array elements
* Output interface:

  * Result (largest number) is stored at `3000H`

## ⚡ TL;DR — Final Working Code

```asm
        ARRAY_BASE  EQU 2500H       ; Input array location
        OUTPUT_ADDR EQU 3000H       ; Output result location

        LXI H, ARRAY_BASE           ; Point to array
        MOV C, M                    ; Load element count
        INX H                       ; Move to first data
        MOV A, M                    ; Initialize max
        DCR C                       ; One used

LOOP:   INX H                       ; Next element
        CMP M                       ; Compare with max
        JNC SKIP                    ; Skip if smaller
        MOV A, M                    ; Update max

SKIP:   DCR C                       ; Count down
        JNZ LOOP                    ; Loop again

        STA OUTPUT_ADDR             ; Store result
        HLT
```

## 🧱 Step 1: Define the Interface — Reading the Array

Before writing any logic, we must answer a question every software engineer should ask:

> **How will this code interact with the rest of the system?**

That’s where the idea of an **interface** comes in.

---

### 📦 What is an Interface?

In software, an *interface* is the **boundary between a module and its environment**. It defines:

* What inputs the module expects
* What outputs it produces
* How the outside world must prepare the data for it to work correctly

In our case, the interface is:

> **The program expects the array to begin at memory location `2500H`, and the first byte should contain the number of elements.**

This is a **data interface**, defined by how we lay out memory.

---

### 🧠 Real-World Parallel

In professional software projects, you’ll rarely get interfaces that are this neat or well-structured.
Instead, you may find:

* Ambiguous formats
* Inconsistent locations
* Poor documentation
* Overloaded or underutilized signals

That’s why thinking about interfaces early is a sign of maturity in programming.

---

### ❌ Bad Interface Examples

Let’s say we defined the array like this:

1. First element is *data*, not size — you'd have to scan till an end marker like `FFH`.
   → Inefficient, error-prone

2. Size is stored separately, say at `3000H`, not near the array.
   → Adds complexity, hurts locality

3. The size is implied by a counter variable elsewhere.
   → Hard to trace, non-obvious

So we deliberately choose a simple interface to make our logic clear and testable.

---

### ✅ Chosen Interface

| Address  | Purpose            |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| `2500H`  | Number of elements |
| `2501H+` | Array elements     |

---

### 🔧 Code (Just Read the Count)

```asm
LXI H, 2500H    ; Point to start of array
MOV C, M        ; Load count into register C
HLT             ; Pause for manual check
```

---

### 🧪 Manual Test

Set memory:

```
2500H = 05H
```

Run the program and inspect **register C** — it should hold `05H`.

---

## 🧱 Step 2: Initialize the Maximum

Now that we’ve read the size of the array into register `C`, we need a **starting value to compare others against**.

We’ll use the **first actual element** of the array as our initial maximum value.

---

### 💡 What We're Doing

* Move HL to point to the **first element** (right after the count)
* Load that value into **accumulator A**
* We will treat this as the maximum for now

This step lays the groundwork for comparisons later.

---

### 🧠 Why This Makes Sense

We don't yet know what the other elements are, but we have to start somewhere. Instead of using a constant like `00H` or `FFH`, we just use the first number in the array — which is **guaranteed to be valid**.

This makes our logic:

* Simpler
* More general
* More efficient

---

### 🔧 Code So Far

```asm
LXI H, 2500H    ; Point to array base
MOV C, M        ; Load count into C
INX H           ; Move to first element
MOV A, M        ; Assume it's the maximum
HLT
```

---

### 🧪 Manual Test

Set memory:

```
2500H = 05H     ; Count
2501H = 23H     ; First data element
```

Expected result:

* Register `C` should be `05H`
* Register `A` should be `23H`

---

### 🛠️ Design Principle: Locality and Meaning

By placing the size and data together, and reading the first item right after the count, our interface remains **self-contained** and **easy to reason about**.

Had we jumped around in memory to find the first element, we'd introduce unnecessary complexity.

---

<AdBlock adSlot="3777463403" layout="in-article" />

## 🧱 Step 3: Compare with the Next Element

We now have:

* The count in `C`
* The current max in `A`
* HL pointing to the first element

It’s time to:

1. Move to the **next** array element
2. Compare it with the current max
3. Update `A` if the new value is greater

We'll do it just **once** in this step — no loop yet.

---

### 💡 What We're Doing

* Decrement `C`, because we already processed one element
* Move HL forward to the second element
* Use `CMP` to compare it with `A`
* If it’s larger, update `A`
* Stop and inspect the result

---

### 🧠 Why Only One Comparison?

We’re **building step-by-step**, and a single comparison helps us verify:

* If comparison works correctly
* If the logic to update max is sound
* That `CMP` + `JNC` behaves as expected

This is our chance to **learn how the carry flag helps** in decision-making.

---

### 🧾 Code

```asm
LXI H, 2500H    ; Start of array
MOV C, M        ; Load count
INX H           ; First element
MOV A, M        ; Initialize max
DCR C           ; One element processed

INX H           ; Move to second element
CMP M           ; Compare A (max) with M (new element)
JNC SKIP        ; Jump if A >= M
MOV A, M        ; Else, update A

SKIP: HLT
```

---

### 🧪 Manual Test

Set memory:

```
2500H = 05H
2501H = 23H
2502H = 45H
```

Expected:

* Register `A` = `45H`

Try switching the numbers:

* `2501H = 77H`, `2502H = 12H` → A should remain `77H`

---

### 🔍 Tip: How `CMP` Works

`CMP M` does: `A - M` but discards the result and just sets flags.

* If A ≥ M → Carry **not** set → `JNC` works (jump = don’t update)
* If A < M → Carry set → `MOV A, M` happens (update)

This is how comparisons are done in 8085.

---

## 🧱 Step 4: Loop Through Remaining Elements

So far, we've compared two elements. Now we'll generalize this to **N elements** using a loop — the essence of all iterative logic.

---

### 🧠 A Loop Is Just State + Repetition

At its core, **every loop — in every programming language — maintains some kind of state**, and then:

1. **Checks a condition**
2. **Performs work**
3. **Updates the state**
4. **Repeats**

In our case, the **state** is:

* The current memory pointer (`HL`)
* The current max (`A`)
* The loop counter (`C`)

The **work** is: compare and update.

The **loop mechanics** are driven by:

```asm
DCR C        ; update loop state
JNZ LOOP     ; repeat if not finished
```

---

### 💡 What We're Doing

* Move through the array one element at a time
* At each step:

  * Compare with current max
  * Update max if needed
  * Decrease the count
* Stop when count hits zero

This is the 8085 way of saying:

> `for (i = 1; i < count; i++) { ... }`

---

### 🧾 Code

```asm
LXI H, 2500H    ; Array base
MOV C, M        ; Load count
INX H           ; Move to first data element
MOV A, M        ; Initialize max
DCR C           ; Already processed one element

LOOP: INX H     ; Move to next element
CMP M           ; Compare with current max
JNC SKIP        ; If A >= M, skip
MOV A, M        ; Else update max

SKIP: DCR C     ; Decrease loop counter
JNZ LOOP        ; If not zero, go again

HLT             ; Done
```

---

### 🧪 Manual Test

Set memory:

```
2500H = 05H
2501H = 23H
2502H = ABH
2503H = 45H
2504H = 99H
2505H = 11H
```

After execution:

* Register `A` = `99H`

Try different variations:

* Largest at start: `2501H = FEH` → No update happens
* Largest at end: `2505H = FFH` → A updated on last iteration
* All equal: `A` remains unchanged

---


## 🧱 Step 5: Store the Result

After looping through the array, we have the **largest number in register A**.

Our job now is to **store it in memory** — this final step makes our program useful.

---

### 💡 What We're Doing

* Store the result from `A` into a predefined memory location (`3000H`)
* Then halt the program

This is how we **communicate the output** of our module to the outside world — completing the contract of our interface.

---

### 🧠 Interfaces Have Two Sides

In Step 1, we discussed how the module reads its **input interface** from memory (`2500H` onward).

Now we’re defining the **output interface** — another memory location where the result will be placed:

```
Output: 3000H → [largest number]
```

This completes the “input-process-output” triangle.

---

### 🧾 Final Code

```asm
LXI H, 2500H    ; Array base
MOV C, M        ; Load count
INX H           ; Move to first data element
MOV A, M        ; Initialize max
DCR C           ; Already processed one element

LOOP: INX H     ; Move to next element
CMP M           ; Compare with current max
JNC SKIP        ; If A >= M, skip
MOV A, M        ; Else update max

SKIP: DCR C     ; Decrease loop counter
JNZ LOOP        ; If not zero, go again

STA 3000H       ; Store the result
HLT
```

---

### 🧪 Manual Test

Set memory:

```
2500H = 05
2501H = 23
2502H = AB
2503H = 45
2504H = 99
2505H = 11
```

Expected:

* After execution, `3000H` should contain `99H`

Try this:

* Change values to `01, 02, 03, 04, 05` → Output should be `05H`

---

## 🧱 Step 6: Refactor the Code for Clarity and Maintainability

Now that the program is working correctly and producing the right result, we take a final but crucial step:

> **Make the code easier to understand, adapt, and maintain — without changing its behavior.**

This is called **refactoring**.

---

### 💡 What is Refactoring?

Refactoring is the process of improving the **structure, readability, and clarity** of a program **without altering what it does**.

You do it *after* the program works — not before — and it often reveals how well you understand the problem.

---

### 🛠️ What We’re Changing (and Why)

#### ✅ 1. Use Constants for Memory Locations

We define `ARRAY_BASE` and `OUTPUT_ADDR` using `EQU`, so if the interface changes, we **only update one place**.

#### ✅ 2. Write Comments That Explain Meaning, Not Mechanics

Instead of `; increment HL`, we write `; move to next element`.
This makes the program readable **even for someone unfamiliar with every instruction**.

---

### 🧾 Refactored Code

```asm
        ; Step 1: Define interface constants
        ARRAY_BASE  EQU 2500H       ; Input array starts here
        OUTPUT_ADDR EQU 3000H       ; Final result goes here

        ; Step 2: Initialize
        LXI H, ARRAY_BASE           ; HL → base of array
        MOV C, M                    ; Load count into C
        INX H                       ; HL → first data element
        MOV A, M                    ; A ← initial max
        DCR C                       ; One element processed

        ; Step 3: Loop through remaining elements
LOOP:   INX H                       ; Move to next element
        CMP M                       ; Compare A with current element
        JNC SKIP                    ; If A ≥ M, keep A
        MOV A, M                    ; Else, update max

SKIP:   DCR C                       ; Reduce remaining count
        JNZ LOOP                    ; Repeat if not done

        ; Step 4: Store the result
        STA OUTPUT_ADDR             ; Save max value
        HLT
```

## 📚 Summary

This problem wasn’t just about finding a maximum value — it taught us how to:

* Define and respect **interfaces** for input and output
* Structure a program incrementally with clarity at each step
* Think in terms of **state and control flow** — the essence of loops
* Use 8085's limited tools to solve meaningful problems
* **Refactor** for readability and maintainability once the logic is correct

👉 In real-world programming, **getting the logic right is only half the work**. Making it understandable and reusable is what makes your code professional.

title: 8085 Program to Find the Sum of Array Elements
description: Use the 8085 microprocessor to compute the sum of a series of numbers stored in memory. This program includes loop logic and carry handling for 8-bit addition.
---

Write an 8085 assembly program that calculates the sum of N 8-bit numbers stored in memory.

* Input:

  * `2500H` = number of elements (N)
  * `2501H` to `2500H + N` = data values
* Output:

  * `3000H` = lower 8 bits of the result (sum)
  * `3001H` = carry flag (0 or 1)

---

## ‚ö° TL;DR ‚Äî Final Working Code

```asm
        ARRAY_BASE  EQU 2500H     ; Input: [2500H] = count, [2501H...] = data
        RESULT_LO   EQU 3000H     ; Output: 8-bit sum
        RESULT_HI   EQU 3001H     ; Output: carry

        LXI H, ARRAY_BASE         ; HL ‚Üí array start
        MOV C, M                  ; C ‚Üê count
        INX H                     ; HL ‚Üí first data element

        MVI A, 00H                ; A ‚Üê running sum
        MVI B, 00H                ; B ‚Üê carry tracker

LOOP:   ADD M                     ; A ‚Üê A + [HL]
        JNC SKIP                  ; If no carry, skip
        INR B                     ; Else, B ‚Üê B + 1

SKIP:   INX H                     ; HL ‚Üí next element
        DCR C                     ; C ‚Üê C - 1
        JNZ LOOP

        STA RESULT_LO             ; Store sum
        MOV A, B
        STA RESULT_HI             ; Store carry
        HLT
```

## üß± Step 1: Define the Interface

Before we do anything, we need to define how the outside world communicates with this program.

> **Every working program needs a working interface.**

This interface tells us:

* **Where to read inputs from**
* **Where to place the output**

---

### üì¶ The Interface We‚Äôll Use

We‚Äôll use memory locations to read and write data:

| Address | Meaning                    |
| ------- | -------------------------- |
| `2500H` | Number of elements (N)     |
| `2501H` | First element              |
| ...     | Next N-1 elements          |
| `3000H` | Output: 8-bit result (sum) |
| `3001H` | Output: Carry (0 or 1)     |

This ensures:

* The array is **self-describing**
* The output is stored clearly and separately
* You can verify the result without checking flags

---

### üß† Why This Is a Good Interface

* **Count-first layout** supports dynamic-sized arrays
* Output address is **predictable and external** ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt overwrite input
* Handles overflow explicitly ‚Äî no hidden flag checking required

---

### ‚ùå Bad Interface Examples

* Putting the sum back into the first array element (overwrites data)
* Using the carry flag without storing it (not visible after program halts)
* Hardcoding the array size in the program instead of reading it

---

### üßæ Code (Read Count Only)

Let‚Äôs just begin by reading the count ‚Äî a foundational step for any loop.

```asm
LXI H, 2500H    ; HL ‚Üí start of array
MOV C, M        ; C ‚Üê number of elements
HLT             ; Pause to inspect C
```

---

### üß™ Manual Test

Set memory:

```
2500H = 04H
```

Expected:

* Register `C` should contain `04H`

This confirms the input interface is working.

---

## üß± Step 2: Sum the First Element

Now that we‚Äôve read how many elements we need to add, it‚Äôs time to:

> Begin adding elements one by one using the accumulator.

We‚Äôll **start small** ‚Äî by adding just the **first element** and observing the result.

---

### üí° What We're Doing

1. Move HL to the **first element** (`2501H`)
2. Initialize accumulator `A` with 0
3. Add the value at `HL` to `A`

We‚Äôll also leave space in register `B` for the carry bit (in case we eventually exceed `FFH`).

---

### üß† Why One Element?

Doing one addition first helps us:

* Validate that we‚Äôre loading values correctly
* See how the `ADD` instruction affects `A` and the carry flag
* Build the core pattern for the loop safely

---

### üßæ Code So Far

```asm
LXI H, 2500H    ; HL ‚Üí start of array
MOV C, M        ; C ‚Üê number of elements
INX H           ; HL ‚Üí first element

MVI A, 00H      ; A ‚Üê 0 (sum)
ADD M           ; A ‚Üê A + [HL]
HLT             ; Check result
```

---

### üß™ Manual Test

Set memory:

```
2500H = 03H
2501H = 2AH
```

Expected:

* Register `A` = `2AH`
* Carry flag not set

Now try:

```
2501H = FFH
```

Expected:

* Register `A` = `FFH`
* Carry flag = 0

Later, if we add more and exceed `FFH`, carry will become important.

---

### üß† Tip: Why Start with A = 00H?

This lets us treat the sum like a growing total, building up from 0 ‚Äî similar to how accumulators work in most languages and CPUs.

---

## üß± Step 3: Loop Through All Elements

We‚Äôve added one element. Now it‚Äôs time to:

> **Loop through the rest of the array** and keep adding each value to the accumulator.

We'll also monitor the **carry flag** in each addition and **track it separately**, using register `B`.

---

### üí° What We're Doing

* Set accumulator `A` to 0 (for the sum)
* Set register `B` to 0 (for total carry)
* Loop through:

  * `ADD M` to add current value to `A`
  * If carry is set, increment `B`
  * Move to next element
  * Decrease counter `C`
* End the loop when `C = 0`

This gives us:

* 8-bit sum in `A`
* Carry count in `B` (will be 1 for simple cases)

---

### üßæ Full Code So Far

```asm
        LXI H, 2500H    ; HL ‚Üí base address
        MOV C, M        ; C ‚Üê count
        INX H           ; HL ‚Üí first element

        MVI A, 00H      ; Accumulator for sum
        MVI B, 00H      ; Carry tracker

LOOP:   ADD M           ; A ‚Üê A + [HL]
        JNC SKIP        ; If no carry, skip incrementing B
        INR B           ; Else, increment carry count

SKIP:   INX H           ; Move to next element
        DCR C           ; Decrease counter
        JNZ LOOP        ; Repeat if elements remain

        HLT             ; Inspect A and B
```

---

### üß™ Manual Test

Set memory:

```
2500H = 03H
2501H = 20H
2502H = 90H
2503H = F0H
```

Manual addition:

* 20H + 90H = B0H ‚Üí no carry
* B0H + F0H = 0AH (carry out)

Expected:

* Register `A` = `0AH`
* Register `B` = `01H`

---

### üß† Tip: Why Track Carry Separately?

8085 only gives us **8-bit math**, but the real sum may be **larger than 255**.
By tracking the carry, we simulate 16-bit addition using two registers.

---

## üß± Step 4: Store the Result in Memory

We now have:

* The **8-bit sum** in register `A`
* The **carry count** in register `B` (either `00H` or `01H` for small arrays)

Our task is to:

> **Store the final result to predefined output addresses** so the rest of the system (or a human) can see the outcome.

---

### üí° What We‚Äôre Doing

* Store the value of `A` (sum) at `3000H`
* Store the value of `B` (carry) at `3001H`

This gives us a **two-byte result**:

* Low byte = `A`
* High byte = `B` (which will be 00H or 01H)

Together, they represent the **true 16-bit sum**:

> `Result = B √ó 256 + A`

---

### üßæ Final Code (So Far)

```asm
        ARRAY_BASE  EQU 2500H
        RESULT_LO   EQU 3000H
        RESULT_HI   EQU 3001H

        LXI H, ARRAY_BASE
        MOV C, M
        INX H

        MVI A, 00H
        MVI B, 00H

LOOP:   ADD M
        JNC SKIP
        INR B

SKIP:   INX H
        DCR C
        JNZ LOOP

        STA RESULT_LO     ; Store sum (A)
        MOV A, B
        STA RESULT_HI     ; Store carry (B)
        HLT
```

---

### üß™ Manual Test

Set memory:

```
2500H = 03H
2501H = 20H
2502H = 90H
2503H = F0H
```

Expected memory after execution:

```
3000H = 0AH   ; Low byte of sum
3001H = 01H   ; High byte of sum (carry)
```

---

### üß† Takeaway

This is a classic 8-bit-to-16-bit pattern in 8085:

* Work within 8-bit constraints
* Track overflow manually
* Store results explicitly

---

## üß± Step 5: Refactor and Clean Up

We‚Äôve built a fully working program to compute the sum of an array, including carry.
Now it's time to refactor ‚Äî to make the program **clearer, more maintainable, and easier to reuse**.

---

### üß† Why Refactor?

We already have a correct solution. But refactoring improves:

* **Readability** for humans
* **Adaptability** for future changes
* **Professionalism** in design

---

### üîß What We‚Äôll Improve

#### ‚úÖ 1. Use `EQU` to Name Addresses

No more magic numbers. Let‚Äôs define constants for:

* Input base
* Output locations

#### ‚úÖ 2. Add Comments That Explain Why, Not Just What

Good comments explain **purpose**, not just **syntax**.

---

### üßæ Refactored Code

```asm
        ; Interface definitions
        ARRAY_BASE  EQU 2500H     ; Start of array (first byte = count)
        RESULT_LO   EQU 3000H     ; Store sum (8-bit)
        RESULT_HI   EQU 3001H     ; Store carry (if any)

        ; Step 1: Load count
        LXI H, ARRAY_BASE         ; HL ‚Üí start of array
        MOV C, M                  ; C ‚Üê number of elements
        INX H                     ; HL ‚Üí first data element

        ; Step 2: Initialize accumulators
        MVI A, 00H                ; A ‚Üê running sum
        MVI B, 00H                ; B ‚Üê carry tracker

LOOP:   ADD M                     ; Add current element to A
        JNC SKIP                  ; If no carry, skip increment
        INR B                     ; Else increment carry

SKIP:   INX H                     ; HL ‚Üí next element
        DCR C                     ; C ‚Üê C - 1
        JNZ LOOP                  ; Repeat if more elements

        ; Step 3: Store result
        STA RESULT_LO             ; Store low byte of sum
        MOV A, B
        STA RESULT_HI             ; Store high byte (carry)
        HLT
```

---

### ‚úÖ What This Achieves

* Makes **intent visible**: `ARRAY_BASE`, `RESULT_LO`, etc., are meaningful
* Keeps the logic easy to modify (e.g., changing output address)
* Provides a clean separation of input, processing, and output

---

## üìö Summary

This problem is simple, but powerful. It teaches:

* How to design a **clean interface** for variable-length input and fixed output
* How to use the **accumulator pattern** in assembly
* How to manage **overflow manually** by tracking the carry flag
* How to structure loops and conditionals using only `ADD`, `JNC`, `INX`, and `DCR`
* The importance of **refactoring** ‚Äî turning a working solution into a readable one

Together, these steps build a strong foundation for more advanced operations like:

* 16-bit additions
* Multi-word arithmetic
* Array-level analytics

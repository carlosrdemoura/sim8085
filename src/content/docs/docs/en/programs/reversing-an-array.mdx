## ⚡ TL;DR — Final Working Code

```asm
        ; Interface constants
        ARRAY_BASE  EQU 2500H       ; Input array with size at [2500H]

        ; Step 1: Load array size
        LXI H, ARRAY_BASE           ; HL → start of array
        MOV C, M                    ; C ← number of elements
        INX H                       ; HL → first element

        ; Step 2: Calculate last element address in DE
        MOV A, C
        ADD L                      ; A ← L + count (low byte math)
        MOV E, A
        MOV D, H
        DCX DE                     ; DE → last element

LOOP:   ; Step 3: Stop if pointers have met or crossed
        MOV A, L
        CMP E
        JNC DONE                   ; If HL ≥ DE, we're done

        ; Step 4: Swap elements at HL and DE
        MOV A, M                   ; A ← [HL]
        XCHG                       ; HL ⇄ DE → HL points to end
        MOV B, M                   ; B ← [DE]
        MOV M, A                   ; [DE] ← A
        XCHG                       ; HL ⇄ DE → HL back to start
        MOV M, B                   ; [HL] ← B

        ; Step 5: Move pointers
        INX H
        DCX DE

        JMP LOOP

DONE:   HLT
```

## 🧱 Step 1: Define the Interface — Reversing an Array

Before writing any logic, we must first ask:

> **How will this program receive input and return output?**

In other words:
**How will the external system interact with our module?**

This is where we define the **interface**.

---

### 📦 What is an Interface?

An **interface** is the agreed-upon way in which our program communicates with the outside world — whether it's hardware, another program, or a human.

It defines:

* **Where** inputs will come from
* **Where** outputs will be placed
* **How** the data will be structured

Without a well-defined interface, even a perfectly correct program is unusable.

---

### ✅ The Interface We’ll Use

We’ll assume:

* The array starts at memory location `2500H`
* The **first byte** at `2500H` contains the number of elements (let’s call this `N`)
* The next `N` bytes are the array elements
* Our program will **reverse those elements in place**

In short:

| Address     | Meaning                |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| `2500H`     | Number of elements (N) |
| `2501H`     | Element 1              |
| `2502H`     | Element 2              |
| ...         | ...                    |
| `2500H + N` | Element N              |

The output will replace the input — this is called an **in-place transformation**.

---

### 🧠 Why This Interface Works Well

This is a **good interface** because:

* It’s **compact** — doesn’t waste memory
* It’s **self-descriptive** — the first byte tells us everything we need
* It’s **easy to test and modify** — you only need to look at one continuous block of memory

---

### ❌ Examples of Poor Interfaces

* Storing the count in one memory location, and the array somewhere else
  → Complicates the setup and increases error risk

* Using a fixed-size array without a count
  → Prevents reuse across different input sizes

* Reversing into a different memory block without need
  → Wastes memory unless absolutely required

---

### 🧾 Code (Just Read the Count)

Let’s begin with a very simple step: **read the count from memory**.

```asm
LXI H, 2500H    ; HL → start of array
MOV C, M        ; C ← number of elements
HLT             ; Pause for inspection
```

---

### 🧪 Manual Test

Set memory before running:

```
2500H = 05H     ; Array length
```

After running, inspect register **C** — it should contain `05H`.

This verifies that our module is correctly reading the external input — the **first requirement** of a well-behaved software component.

---

## 🧱 Step 2: Set Up Two Pointers for Swapping

Now that we’ve read the number of elements, it’s time to decide **how we will perform the reversal**.

And the answer lies in a classic strategy:

> **Use two pointers — one starting at the beginning of the array, and one at the end. Swap their contents and move them toward each other until they meet.**

---

### 🧠 Why Two Pointers?

Every reversal is a **series of swaps**:

* Swap element 1 with N
* Swap element 2 with N-1
* …
* Stop when the pointers cross or become equal

This pattern is elegant, fast, and works for **both even and odd lengths**.

---

### 💡 What We’re Doing in This Step

We will:

1. Point `HL` to the **first element** (`2501H`)
2. Calculate the address of the **last element** and point `DE` there

   * If count = 5, last element = `2500H + 5` = `2505H`

So:

* `HL` → left side of the array
* `DE` → right side of the array

---

### 🔧 Code

```asm
LXI H, 2500H    ; HL → start of array
MOV C, M        ; C ← count
INX H           ; HL → first data element (2501H)

; Compute address of last element in DE
MOV B, 00H      ; Clear upper byte
MOV A, C        ; A ← count
ADD L           ; Add count to lower byte of HL
MOV E, A        ; E ← result low byte
MOV D, H        ; D ← same as high byte (no carry handling)

HLT             ; Pause and inspect HL and DE
```

📝 We’re **assuming** the array fits within the same 256-byte page (no carry in `ADD L`).

---

### 🧪 Manual Test

Set memory:

```
2500H = 05H
```

Expected:

* HL = `2501H` → first element
* DE = `2506H` → one past the last element, i.e., ready for `DCX DE` → `2505H` (last)

Run `DCX DE` and verify:

* DE now points to `2505H`, the last element

---

### 🧠 Conceptual Takeaway

We’ve now prepared the **two memory addresses** we’ll use to start swapping from both ends. This is the foundation of our loop.

---

<AdBlock adSlot="3777463403" layout="in-article" />

## 🧱 Step 3: Swap One Pair of Elements

With:

* `HL` pointing to the **first element**
* `DE` pointing to the **last element**

We now perform the **core operation** of reversal:

> Swap the values at the two ends.

We'll do this just **once** in this step — not in a loop yet — so we can clearly observe and test the behavior.

---

### 💡 Why a Single Swap First?

* Validates that we’re accessing memory correctly
* Lets us inspect memory to verify the swap
* Builds the exact logic that we’ll later repeat in a loop

---

### 🧠 How to Swap in 8085

8085 doesn’t have a single `SWAP` instruction — we use a **temporary register** to hold one value while we transfer the other.

Here's the general idea:

```asm
MOV A, M     ; A ← [HL]
XCHG         ; HL ⇄ DE → HL now points to end
MOV B, M     ; B ← [DE]
MOV M, A     ; [DE] ← A (was from left)
XCHG         ; HL ⇄ DE → HL back to left
MOV M, B     ; [HL] ← B (was from right)
```

---

### 🧾 Full Code So Far (with Swap)

```asm
LXI H, 2500H        ; HL → start of array
MOV C, M            ; C ← count
INX H               ; HL → first element

; Compute last element pointer
MOV B, 00H
MOV A, C
ADD L               ; A ← L + count
MOV E, A            ; DE → last element (approx)
MOV D, H
DCX DE              ; DE → exact last element

; Swap values at HL and DE
MOV A, M            ; A ← [HL]
XCHG                ; HL ⇄ DE → HL → end
MOV B, M            ; B ← [DE]
MOV M, A            ; [DE] ← value from start
XCHG                ; HL ⇄ DE → HL → start
MOV M, B            ; [HL] ← value from end

HLT
```

---

### 🧪 Manual Test

Set memory:

```
2500H = 05H
2501H = A1H
2502H = 22H
2503H = 33H
2504H = 44H
2505H = B5H
```

Expected:

* After execution:

  * `2501H` = B5H
  * `2505H` = A1H

Middle elements untouched (for now)

---

### 🧠 What We’ve Built

You’ve now created the **fundamental swap operation** that will be repeated in a loop.

---

## 🧱 Step 4: Loop the Swapping Process

We’ve successfully swapped one pair of elements. Now we’ll **loop this logic** until the array is fully reversed.

---

### 🧠 When to Stop Swapping?

We stop when the **left and right pointers meet or cross**.

That is:

* As long as `HL < DE`, we keep swapping
* Once `HL = DE` or `HL > DE`, we halt

This gives us a **clean exit condition** without needing to track how many swaps remain.

---

### 💡 How to Check for `HL < DE`?

8085 doesn’t support direct 16-bit comparison between registers like `HL < DE`, but we can simulate it.

To keep things simple, we use a trick:

```asm
MOV A, L
CMP E
JNC DONE     ; Jump if HL ≥ DE
```

📝 **This works because we’re assuming the array size is less than 128 bytes**, so the sum of the base address (`2500H`) and the count will not cause a carry into the higher byte (`H`). That means:

* `H` and `D` remain equal throughout the loop
* So comparing the **low bytes (`L` and `E`) is enough**

If the array were allowed to span across pages (e.g., cross from `25FFH` to `2600H`), we’d need to compare high bytes too.

---

### 🧾 Loop + Full Logic (Starting from Swap Setup)

```asm
        ; Setup
        LXI H, 2500H
        MOV C, M
        INX H               ; HL → first element

        MOV A, C
        ADD L
        MOV E, A
        MOV D, H
        DCX DE              ; DE → last element

LOOP:   ; Stop if HL ≥ DE
        MOV A, L
        CMP E
        JNC DONE

        ; Swap HL and DE
        MOV A, M
        XCHG
        MOV B, M
        MOV M, A
        XCHG
        MOV M, B

        ; Move HL forward, DE backward
        INX H
        DCX DE

        JMP LOOP

DONE:   HLT
```

---

### 🧪 Manual Test

Set memory:

```
2500H = 05H
2501H = 11H
2502H = 22H
2503H = 33H
2504H = 44H
2505H = 55H
```

Expected:

* After execution:

  * `2501H` = 55H
  * `2502H` = 44H
  * `2503H` = 33H
  * `2504H` = 22H
  * `2505H` = 11H

---

### 🧠 Takeaway

We’ve now turned a basic swap into a **controlled, repeatable, and terminating loop**.

---

## 🧱 Step 5: Refactor and Improve

We’ve built a correct and working program. Now it’s time to ask the critical final question:

> **Can this code be made easier to understand and maintain — without changing what it does?**

This is the process of **refactoring**.

---

### 🧠 What is Refactoring?

Refactoring is the practice of **improving the clarity, structure, and readability** of code **without changing its behavior**.

We do it only **after** the code is correct, and it’s a sign of disciplined software development.

---

### 🔧 What We’ll Improve

#### ✅ 1. Introduce Named Constants

Rather than using raw addresses like `2500H` and `3000H` everywhere, we define meaningful names using `EQU`. This makes it easier to change interfaces later.

#### ✅ 2. Add Semantic Comments

Instead of explaining *what the instruction does* (e.g., `; increment HL`), we write **why** we’re doing it (e.g., `; move to next element`).

---

### 🧾 Refactored Code

```asm
        ; Interface constants
        ARRAY_BASE  EQU 2500H       ; Input array with size at [2500H]
        
        ; Step 1: Load array size
        LXI H, ARRAY_BASE           ; HL → start of array
        MOV C, M                    ; C ← number of elements
        INX H                       ; HL → first element

        ; Step 2: Calculate last element address in DE
        MOV A, C
        ADD L                      ; A ← L + count (low byte math)
        MOV E, A
        MOV D, H
        DCX DE                     ; DE → last element

LOOP:   ; Step 3: Stop if pointers have met or crossed
        MOV A, L
        CMP E
        JNC DONE                   ; If HL ≥ DE, we're done

        ; Step 4: Swap elements at HL and DE
        MOV A, M                   ; A ← [HL]
        XCHG                       ; HL ⇄ DE → HL points to end
        MOV B, M                   ; B ← [DE]
        MOV M, A                   ; [DE] ← A
        XCHG                       ; HL ⇄ DE → HL back to start
        MOV M, B                   ; [HL] ← B

        ; Step 5: Move pointers
        INX H
        DCX DE

        JMP LOOP

DONE:   HLT
```

---

### ✨ What We Gained

* The code is now **self-documenting**
* Changing the base address is trivial — update `ARRAY_BASE` and you’re done
* Anyone reading this after 6 months will still understand what it does

## 📚 Summary

This problem is not just about flipping values in memory — it's a perfect exercise in **low-level thinking**, where you:

* Define a **clear interface** for both input and output
* Set up **two pointers** to implement a classic algorithm
* Use simple tools (`XCHG`, `MOV`, `CMP`) to build powerful behavior
* Understand the concept of **stateful loops and memory traversal**
* Practice **refactoring** to make your code clean, reusable, and readable

This kind of step-by-step construction teaches not just 8085 — but timeless software design habits.

## 📝 Exercises

---

### 1. 🔁 Handle Large Arrays that Span Across Pages

**Problem:**
The current program assumes that adding the array size to the pointer won’t overflow into the next memory page (i.e., `L + N` stays under `100H`).
This fails when the array is large (e.g., size = 130).

**Your Task:**

* Modify the part of the code where we compute the last element (`DE`)
* Add proper handling for **carry from low byte to high byte**
* Ensure that `D` (high byte) is incremented if `L + C` causes a carry

**Hint:** Use:

```asm
MOV A, L
ADD C
MOV E, A
MOV A, H
ACI 00H      ; Add carry from previous ADD
MOV D, A
```

**Test Case:**

```
2500H = 82H   ; 130 elements
2501H = 01H
...
```

---

### 2. 🧩 Break the Program into Subroutines

**Problem:**
Right now, everything is inlined in a single `MAIN` block.
But in real-world assembly, clarity and reuse come from splitting logic into **modular subroutines**.

**Your Task:**

* Break the program into these subroutines:

  1. `GET_LAST_PTR`: Given `HL` and count in `C`, return last element address in `DE`
  2. `SWAP`: Swaps values at `HL` and `DE`
  3. `SHOULD_CONTINUE`: Checks if `HL < DE`, sets Z flag appropriately

* In `MAIN`, call these routines in a loop

**Bonus:**
Make `REVERSE_ARRAY` its own subroutine so you can call it from other programs with `HL` pointing to the count.

**Benefits:**

* Cleaner logic
* Reusability
* Easier to test and modify each part independently

title: 8085 Program to Find Largest and Smallest in an Array
description: An 8085 assembly program that scans a block of numbers in memory to determine both the largest and the smallest values, storing the results in dedicated memory locations.
---

import AdBlock from "../../../../../components/AdBlock.astro";

Write an 8085 assembly program that:

* Reads a block of N 8-bit numbers from memory (`2500H` = count, `2501H‚Ä¶` = data)
* Finds the **largest** and **smallest** values in the array
* Stores the results as:

  * `3000H` = largest value
  * `3001H` = smallest value

Assume N is a small positive integer (e.g., ‚â§‚ÄØ16). This is a classic array scan using comparison and branch logic.

## ‚ö° TL;DR ‚Äî Final Working Code

```asm
        ; Interface constants
        ARRAY_ADDR     EQU 2500H
        MAX_OUTPUT     EQU 3000H
        MIN_OUTPUT     EQU 3001H

        ; Step 1: Load array count and first element
        LXI H, ARRAY_ADDR
        MOV C, M             ; C ‚Üê count (N)
        INX H
        MOV A, M             ; A ‚Üê first value (max)
        MOV B, M             ; B ‚Üê also min
        INX H
        DCR C                ; Already processed one

        ; Step 2: Loop through array
LOOP:   MOV D, M             ; D ‚Üê current element
        CMP D
        JNC SKIP_MAX
        MOV A, D             ; Update max
SKIP_MAX:
        MOV E, D
        MOV D, B
        CMP E
        JC SKIP_MIN
        MOV B, E             ; Update min
SKIP_MIN:
        INX H
        DCR C
        JNZ LOOP

        ; Step 3: Store results
        LXI H, MAX_OUTPUT
        MOV M, A             ; Store max
        INX H
        MOV M, B             ; Store min
        HLT
```

## üß± Step 1: Define the Interface

Before any code, define how input and output are communicated:

| Address  | Meaning                |
| -------- | ---------------------- |
| `2500H`  | Number of elements (N) |
| `2501H‚Ä¶` | Array of N elements    |
| `3000H`  | Output: largest value  |
| `3001H`  | Output: smallest value |

**Why this matters:**
A clear interface makes testing easy and ensures correct data flow. It‚Äôs the contract your program must adhere to.

**How to test it:**
In Sim8085, set `2500H = 04H`, and memory `2501H‚Ä¶2504H` to known values (e.g., `30H, 10H, 50H, 20H`). Then inspect memory after steps complete to verify setup.

---

## üß± Step 2: Initialize Registers and Setup the Scan

Before scanning the array, we need to load the data and prepare storage for the current largest and smallest values.

---

### üß† What We're Doing

* Load the count (N) from `2500H` into register `C`
* Use the first data element (at `2501H`) to initialize:

  * `A` as the **current maximum**
  * `B` as the **current minimum**
* Set `HL` to point to the next array element (start of the loop)

---

### üßæ Code (Initialization)

```asm
LXI H, 2500H     ; HL ‚Üí count
MOV C, M         ; C ‚Üê number of elements (N)
INX H            ; HL ‚Üí first element
MOV A, M         ; A ‚Üê first value (initial max)
MOV B, M         ; B ‚Üê also set as initial min
INX H            ; HL ‚Üí next element for loop
DCR C            ; We've already processed one
HLT
```

---

### üß™ Manual Test

Set memory:

```
2500H = 04H
2501H = 30H
2502H = 10H
2503H = 50H
2504H = 20H
```

Expected after halt:

* `A` = 30H (max)
* `B` = 30H (min)
* `C` = 03H (remaining elements)
* `HL` = 2502H (next value to compare)

This prepares us to scan through the rest of the array in Step 3.

## üß± Step 3: Loop Through the Array and Compare

Now that we've initialized the maximum (`A`) and minimum (`B`) values using the first element, we loop through the remaining elements and compare each one with both `A` and `B`.

---

### üß† What We're Doing

* At each step:

  * Compare the current element (`M`) with the value in `A` (max)
    * If it's larger, update `A`
  * Then compare the same element with `B` (min)
    * If it's smaller, update `B`
* Decrement `C` each time ‚Äî the loop runs `N‚àí1` times
* Use conditional jumps (`JC`, `JNC`) to decide when to update

---

### üßæ Code (Compare and Loop)

```asm
LOOP: MOV D, M         ; D ‚Üê current element
      CMP D            ; Compare A (max) with D
      JNC SKIP_MAX     ; If A ‚â• D, skip updating max
      MOV A, D         ; A ‚Üê new max

SKIP_MAX:
      MOV E, D         ; E ‚Üê same current element
      MOV D, B         ; D ‚Üê current min
      CMP E            ; Compare B (min) with current element
      JC SKIP_MIN      ; If B < E, skip updating min
      MOV B, E         ; B ‚Üê new min

SKIP_MIN:
      INX H            ; HL ‚Üí next element
      DCR C
      JNZ LOOP
HLT
```

---

### üß™ Manual Test (Continued)

With:

```
2500H = 04H
2501H = 30H
2502H = 10H
2503H = 50H
2504H = 20H
```

After execution:

* `A` should contain `50H` (largest)
* `B` should contain `10H` (smallest)

The loop completes the core logic. Next, we‚Äôll store the results into memory.

---

## üß± Step 4: Store the Results in Memory

After scanning the entire array:

* Register `A` holds the **largest** value
* Register `B` holds the **smallest** value

We now store these results at their designated memory addresses to make them observable and usable outside the program.

---

### üì¶ Output Mapping

| Address | Meaning        |
| ------- | -------------- |
| `3000H` | Largest value  |
| `3001H` | Smallest value |

---

### üßæ Code (Store Phase)

```asm
LXI H, 3000H     ; HL ‚Üí output location
MOV M, A         ; Store largest at 3000H
INX H            ; HL ‚Üí 3001H
MOV M, B         ; Store smallest at 3001H
HLT
```

This completes the program‚Äôs contract:
‚úÖ Read array ‚Üí ‚úÖ Compare each element ‚Üí ‚úÖ Write final results

---

### üß™ Manual Test

For input:

```
2500H = 04H
2501H = 30H
2502H = 10H
2503H = 50H
2504H = 20H
```

Expected output after execution:

```
3000H = 50H   ; Largest
3001H = 10H   ; Smallest
```

## üìö Summary

This program walks through an array in memory and identifies both the **largest** and **smallest** 8-bit values using straightforward comparison and conditional logic.

**Key concepts covered:**

* Initializing state from the first element
* Comparing elements using `CMP`, `JNC`, and `JC`
* Using registers (`A`, `B`) as running max/min
* Writing outputs clearly and predictably to memory

The program uses no subroutines or extra memory, everything is done using registers and direct memory access, making it perfect for learning array processing in 8085 assembly.

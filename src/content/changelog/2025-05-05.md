### 💡 LED Array Connected to J3

Sim8085 now includes a **virtual LED Array** connected to **port J3**, letting you simulate LED output visually:

```asm
MVI A, 55H
OUT 03H ; lights up alternating LEDs
HLT
```

This is perfect for writing I/O programs that display patterns or signals, such as binary counters or blinking sequences.

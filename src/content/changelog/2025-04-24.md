### Added support for multiple labels

Programs such as the one below failed to assemble earlier,

```asm
; Program with multiple labels for single statement

JMP INIT

;data
STR: DB 'HELLO'

INIT:
START:
MVI A, STR

HLT
```

```

```

These programs are now supported by the assembler.

Note that you **cannot** add multiple labels to data definitions such as
`DB`, `EQU`, `SET` and others.

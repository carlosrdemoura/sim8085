### 🧠 RIM & SIM Instruction Support

Sim8085 now supports the **RIM** (Read Interrupt Mask) and **SIM** (Set Interrupt Mask) instructions — enabling simulation of advanced interrupt behavior and control flags.

- You can now write programs that **read and modify interrupt masks** using `RIM` and `SIM`.
- Useful for implementing software-based interrupt control and serial I/O logic.

```asm
SIM ; Configure interrupt masks or SOD
RIM ; Read interrupt masks and pending RSTs
```

### 🚨 RST Instruction and Interrupts

Support for `RST n` instructions (software interrupts) is now included!

You can now write monitor-style programs and test interrupt service routines:

```asm
RST 7 ; Jump to 0038H
```

This opens the door to more **realistic system-level programming** and educational use cases.

### 🧰 SIM/RIM ↔ Number Converter Tool

A new section has been added to the **Toolbox Panel** to decode and encode values for SIM and RIM instructions.

- Visualize the meaning of each bit in SIM/RIM values
- Easily toggle flags and copy the result into your program

> This is especially helpful when setting up SOD, interrupt masks, and checking pending interrupts.

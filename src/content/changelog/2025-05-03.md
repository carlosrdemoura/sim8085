### ‚ú® Added Support for Long-Running Programs

Sim8085 can now handle programs with infinite loops, such as those that generate square waves:

```asm
ORG 00H

WHILE:
      MVI A, 00H
      OUT 02H
      MVI D, 0FFH
      MVI E, 0FFH
      CALL DELAY
      MVI A, 01H
      OUT 02H
      MVI D, 0FFH
      MVI E, 0FFH
      CALL DELAY
      JMP WHILE
      HLT

DELAY:
       DCX     D
       MOV     A,D
       ORA     E
       JNZ     DELAY
       RET
```

Previously, such programs could freeze the browser due to tight loops. This update introduces **Instruction Timing Mode**, a new simulator setting that emulates instruction execution delays more realistically.

When enabled, the simulator inserts delays based on actual 8085 timing, allowing the host browser to remain responsive ‚Äî even for infinite or long-running loops.

> **Note**: Instruction Timing Mode is **off by default**. You must enable it before running time-sensitive or infinite loop programs.

This lays the groundwork for exciting features like:

- Interactive programs (e.g., waiting for keyboard input)
- Monitor programs that rely on polling loops
- Realistic peripheral emulation in future updates

### üõ†Ô∏è Minor Fixes

- When using the **Full Memory View**, searched rows now appear at the **top** of the view instead of the bottom ‚Äî making them easier to find.

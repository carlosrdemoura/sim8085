### 🧹 Code Formatter

Sim8085 now includes a built-in **code formatting tool** to clean up and align your 8085 assembly code — making it more readable and consistent with traditional 3-column style:

- 🧠 **Smart Label-Aware Formatting**
  Labels are aligned to the left, and if a label is too long, the instruction is moved to the next line automatically.

- 🧱 **Mnemonic and Operand Alignment**
  Instructions and operands are neatly spaced into consistent columns, making the structure of your code easier to follow.

- ✍️ **Comment Preservation**
  Comments are retained exactly where you typed them — whether inline or on standalone lines.

- ✨ **Blank Line Preservation**
  Your original blank lines are preserved, so logical sections of your program remain visually distinct.

🧪 **Note:** This feature is still in testing. If you notice any formatting issues or edge cases, please [report them on GitHub](https://github.com/debjitbis08/sim8085/issues).
